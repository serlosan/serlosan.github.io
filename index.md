I am a third year graduate student at the Department of Linguistics and Basque Studies of the University of the Basque Country under the supervision of Prof. Itziar Laka. My main research interest is the interaction of memory and prediction mechanisms in sentence comprehension. For that purpose, I investigate how comprehenders process filler-gap dependencies, that is, sentences in which there is a displaced constituent that needs to be interpreted in a different position.
