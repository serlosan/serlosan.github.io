title: About
---

I'm a psycholinguist with a strong interest in human language and data science. I'm also interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP), i.e. the intersection between human language, computer science and artificial intelligence. I'm currently working for Amazon, where I use NLP tools to make [Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa) understand Spanish in a more efficient and natural way. 

I graduated from the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) with a doctoral dissertation entitled *Understanding Dependencies in Real Time: A Crosslinguistic Investigation of Antecedent Complexity and Dependency Length* (available [here](http://www.ehu.eus/HEB/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SLS_PhDdissertation_Final.pdf)), combining both EEG and behavioral methods to investigate how humans process dependencies between non-adjacent words or phrases. I also hold an MA in Linguistics from the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) and a BA in English Philology from the University of Oviedo (five-year program), where I also defended an honors thesis entitled *The Subjunctive Mood in English and Spanish: A Contrastive Study*.
