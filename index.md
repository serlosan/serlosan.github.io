I am a last year graduate student at the Department of Linguistics and Basque Studies of the University of the Basque Country under the supervision of Prof. Itziar Laka. My main research interest is the interaction of memory and prediction mechanisms in sentence comprehension. I investigate how comprehenders process linguistic dependencies, that is, constituents that are linearly apart but need to be integrated syntactically and semantically to get a full understanding of the sentence.
